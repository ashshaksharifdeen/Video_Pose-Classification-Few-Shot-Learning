# Video Frame Adaptation with MAML

This repository contains the implementation of Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) for adapting models to individual frames of video data. The goal is to enable models to learn adaptable strategies for diverse tasks, ensuring flexibility across multiple scenarios.

## Features

- Pre-processes the CAUCAFall dataset in video format.
- Passes each frame as an image into the model for adaptation using MAML.
- Demonstrates how MAML empowers models to learn adaptable strategies for diverse tasks, ensuring flexibility across multiple scenarios.
